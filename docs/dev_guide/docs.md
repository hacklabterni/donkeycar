If you're already signed into Github, this will take you to the GitHub editor, where you can edit in the browser. If not, you'll have to sign into Github first. Github will automatically create a branch for your edits. 

Once you're done with your edits, go to the bottom of the page where you'll find the Commit Changes section. Enter a brief description of your changes ("fixed broken link" or "explained this part better").

Click on "Commit Changes" and we can go to the next step, the Pull Request
